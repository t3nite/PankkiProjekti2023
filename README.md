## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project was to simulate an ATM machine. There are two accounts: one with credit and another with only debit. 

The project was originally designed for a team of four people, but in my team, there were only two. I worked on the frontend, and my co-student handled the backend. We used RFID readers and USB sticks as "cards."
